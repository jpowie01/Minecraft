# Minecraft
This project was designed to remake the basics of Minecraft. Game's world was generated by Perlin's 3D Noise. Then I've made some improvements with optimization, such as erasing block's faces that won't be shown with this setting of blocks. Watch out - it's just a prototype code.

### Technology
The project was written in C++, using SFML 2.3 and OpenGL 3.2 in Xcode 5 and tested under OS X 10.8 and 10.9.

### Project's state
It was programmed at the beginning of 2014, when I was in high school (3rd grade). But I didn't have enough time, so I had to suspend this project.

### Functionality
I've programmed these functions:
- generating world (water, mountains, caves),
- loading textures,
- rendering world,
- water's at the same level on whole map,
- walking (without collisions),
- adding blocks to the world.

### Done partly
Partly coded functions:
- erasing blocks.

### Steering
- WASD - walking,
- LMB - adding block,
- SPACEBAR - flying up,
- SHIFT - falling down,
- ESC - exit.
